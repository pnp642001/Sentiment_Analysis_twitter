# Twitter Sentiment Analysis




## Project Description

This is a group project specifically developed to exercise the knowledge gained in the domains of machine learning, data pre-processing, web development, and also in the databases.

The project is a two phase project. 

The first phase of the project is about developing a EDA Generator. This phase is discussed in another repository.

This was the second phase of the group project. This phase is about the sentiment analysis.
We all know about the sentiments. The concept of sentiment analysis on twitter is not new as well. However, our main goal and motivation behind undertaking this project is to learn more and more in-depth about the machine learning and how to club it with the front-end with the help of the pipeline.

### NOTE:
